In Kalman filters the distribution is given by what we called a Gaussian and a Gaussian is a continuous function over the space of locations in the area underneath sums up to one.A Gaussian is characterized by two parameters:


    •	The mean often abbreviated with the Greek letter Mu 
    •	The width of the Gaussian often called Variance.
